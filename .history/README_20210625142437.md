# swagger-controls

Convert classes to swagger documentation using NestJs decorators without the full commitment to NestJs

Use this tool when full NestJs adoption is too steep of a curve for your team or project. Use swagger-controls when you know you want those great swagger documentation decorators but your project still needs to maintain an Express middleware like approach.


### Is this a replacement for NestJs?

Not at all. All this library does is use NestJs functionality to generate a swagger.json file from decorated classes.
