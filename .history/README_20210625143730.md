# swagger-controls

Convert classes to swagger documentation using NestJs decorators without the full commitment to NestJs

Use this tool when full NestJs adoption is too steep of a curve for your team or project. Use swagger-controls when you know you want those great swagger documentation decorators but your project still needs to maintain an Express middleware like approach.


### Is this a replacement for NestJs?

Not at all. This library simply uses NestJs decorative functionality to assist in generating a Swagger files.

### Example

A single route `/v1/health-check` with well defined responses

```
@Controller('/v1/health-check')
export class HealthCheck {
  @Get()
  @ApiOperation({
    summary: 'Check on the status or health of API',
    description: 'Acts as a ping and a status indicator of accessible services',
  })
  @ApiResponse({
    status: HttpStatus.OK, type: HealthOutput,
    description: 'Very basic connectivity report',
  })
  @ApiResponse({
    status: HttpStatus.SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE, type: HealthOutput,
    description: 'Connection to additional services is in an invalid state',
  })
  get(): HealthOutput {
    return new HealthOutput()
  }
}

// Response to /v1/health-check calls
class HealthOutput {
  @ApiProperty({example: 'ok'})
  status: 'ok' = 'ok'
}
```
